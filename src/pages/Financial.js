      <p>The Financial District in downtown San Francisco is the heart of the City. You can shop at high-end stores such as Dior, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton. For a real SF experience, consider riding the MUNI, the City's steet car lines. Download the free MUNI app on your phone to purchase tickets.</p>
