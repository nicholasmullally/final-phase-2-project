          Golden Gate Park is located on the western edge of San Francisco with a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. It has a beautiful conservatory of flowers, as well as an aquarium. After your visit, you might relax with a picnic lunch at Baker Beach. Bring a sweater, as SF can be chilly even in the middle of summer.
