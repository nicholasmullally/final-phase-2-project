      <div>Fisherman's Wharf is often very crowded and has excellent people watching. You might be able to catch performers busking for cash while you browse for souvenirs. The Ghiradelli Chocolate Factory is at the western edge of the Wharf. Stop by the Blue Mermaid for some of the City's best clam chowder and consider dining al fresco to take in the view.</div>
