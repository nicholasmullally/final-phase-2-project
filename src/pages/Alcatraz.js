      <p>Located just a mile offshore, Alcatraz Island was used as a prison from 1934 to 1963. It is a 15 minute ferry ride from Pier 33 at Fisherman's Wharf.</p> 
      <p>There were numerous escape attempts by inmates over the course of the prison's history. The most famous occured on June 11, 1962 when three prisoners managed to escape the island and were never heard from again. It's possible they drowned in the strong current in the Bay, but who knows? Maybe they made it out alive.</p>
